# 3dincontext2d
Early version of a (not optimized) 3D renderer built in JS for context2d

Runs horribly.

##Two versions available: 
* LEGACY, which was the test run for the script and therefore runs poorly.
* VOLUMES OF REVOLUTION, which was the result of the renderer I used for my AP Calc BC final project, and allows inputting 2 algebraic equations to revolve around the x-axis.
